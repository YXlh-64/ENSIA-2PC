This directory contains a set of solutions implemented by Dr. Lassouaoui who is no longer teaching at the school, I want to thank him through this small message on behalf of all my schoolmates for his hard work and dedication. I am pretty sure that we are all going to benefit from his work for a long time.
Make sure to check his code, it is really professional and very well documented.
