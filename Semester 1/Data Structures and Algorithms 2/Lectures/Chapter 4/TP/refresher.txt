    The root node is A
    The leaf nodes are: G, H, I, L, M, and K
    The depth of the tree is 4 (the depth of the tree is the 
depth of the deapest leaf node the maximum depth of the leaf nodes)
    The output of:
inorder:   GDHBIELJMACFK
preorder:  ABDGHEIJLMCFK 
postorder: GHDILMJEBKFCA
    Computing the height, depth and listing the parent, child, and sibling nodes
for A:
    * the parent node: none
    * the child nodes: B, C
    * siblings: none
    * height: 4
    * depth: 0
for E:
    * the parent node: B
    * the child nodes:  I, J
    * the siblings: D
    * height: 2
    * depth: 2
for F:
    * the parent node: C
    * the child nodes: K
    * the siblings: none
    * height: 1
    * depth: 2
